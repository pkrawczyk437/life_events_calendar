- App was created in react.js
- My main focus of this app was to use component lifecycle methods in practice and learnt how to clear component when it will be unmounted,
- I also learnt how to use setInterval and clearInterval methods - here I used it for countdown timer, which will be counting down our time for this particular event in year-month-day-hours-minutes-seconds format(used for this moment.js features)
- I also added some styles and this app is fully responsive.
